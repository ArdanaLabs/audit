# Ardana Audit

The audit will be a document published at launch and signed by Platonic.Systems. 

It is not intended to convey our 200% confidence in the system and implementation, rather it is intended to convey that we did due diligence with limited time. 

Toward the very end, a writing expert will take a pass to make sure we're adequately conveying the varying confidence levels throughout the document. 

## Notes on the overall audit philosophy

### On the approach
There are a number of ways to go about this. 

The first way we talked about was to provide a list of desirable properties and find ways to verify or validate them. This is a sort of _positive approach_, it talks about things we want. 

Another angle is for me to write up my understanding of all the ecosystem functionalities one at a time and point out some threatmodels along the way. This is a sort of _negative approach_, it talks about things we don't want.

The problem with both approaches is the distance between _pointing out_ properties and _implementing/defending against them_ depending on if it's the positive or negative case. Also keep in mind that in some sense the audit is a "warmup" for a post-launch formal verification. 

We should also clearly define what we think a secure DeX even is.
