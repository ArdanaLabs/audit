# Ardana Audit

We can migrate some of the drafting process to gdocs if comments and suggestions functionality would add value over gh. Otherwise, I think issues and pull request comment threads could be nice-- open a PR for perhaps a nearly trivial change and we can proceed to discuss in the comments there. - Q 09-12

## Notes on the overall audit philosophy

- **The community is the audience. The community is the customer.** 
- I think we want to make an explicit demarcation of risks for whom. Some risks only effect Ardana internally, other risks effect the collective of Dana holders, other risks effect our neighbors in the ecosystem. I think there's a difference between risks we want to eliminate and risks we want to empower the community to take. I'm sort of imagining profiling these as separate _axes_ of risk. The idea here is that I'm frustrated with the literature because it almost feels like it uses the word "attack" anytime someone loses money. This is not adequate- sometimes you just gambled and lost, sometimes the "attacker" followed the rules of the mechanism as designed. There's a morality/values question to each attack, and **the audit needs to provide disambiguation and clarity without taking sides on each values/morality question**. 
- The audit is **as much as was possible to do before launch time, not exhaustive**.

We should also clearly define what we think a secure DeX even is.
