    "\n",
    "Leaving $\\chi$ in a black box sabotages any chance at characterizing the polynomial a priori. It is my opinion that we we can best reason about the behavior of the solver if the invariant function is given in polynomials of $D$ and of $x_k$ at a fixed, known value of $\\chi$. \n",

    "1. $A > n^{-n}$ (equivalently $An^n > 1$) how often? \n",
    "2. Upper bound for $D$.\n",

    "1. The characterization of some relation between $-A n^{2n} (\\Pi x_i) \\Sigma x_i$ and $(A - n^{-n})n^{2n} (\\Pi x_i)$ (the constant and linear coefficients of $f_D$, respectively) i.e. \"$<$ by how much? What are the pathologies where $\\geq$ if any?\"\n",
    "2. The characterization of some relation between $\\frac{-D^{n+1}}{A n^{2n}\\Pi_{i \\neq k} x_i}$ and $\\Sigma_{i \\neq k} x_i + (\\frac{1}{A n^n} - 1) D$ (the constant and linear coefficients of $f_k$, respectively) i.e. \"$<$ by how much? What are the pathologies where $\\geq$ if any?\"\n",

Notice we are confident that this root does not equal zero, because the prehoc probability of $A = n^{-n}$ is slim, and in practice value of $A$ is known well before the caller invokes the solver.
