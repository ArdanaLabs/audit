# Audit Roadmap

There are a number of ways to go about this. 

_Not currently a super great document - Q 09-12_

The first way we talked about was to provide a list of desirable properties and find ways to verify or validate them. This is a sort of _positive approach_, it talks about things we want. 

Another angle is for me to write up my understanding of all the ecosystem functionalities one at a time and point out some threatmodels along the way. This is a sort of _negative approach_, it talks about things we don't want.

The problem with both approaches is the distance between _pointing out_ properties and _implementing/defending against them_ depending on if it's the positive or negative case. Also keep in mind that in some sense the audit is a "warmup" for a post-launch formal verification.
