# Vampire attack

Wouldn't it be great if there were unique affordances by Cardano itself that prevented vampire attack? 

## What is it? 

According to my research, this attack happened once. [Finematics' coverage is excellent, so I'll defer explanation of the base level occurrence to them](https://finematics.com/vampire-attack-sushiswap-explained/). But here I will attempt to provide a generalized notion.
