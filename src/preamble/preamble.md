The audit is a preliminary effort to provide the Cardano community a thorough technical review of Ardana's Danaswap DApp in a situation where formal verification before launch is infeasible. 

An audit means many things. Let's be precise about what we mean by audit in this document.

\begin{definition}[Audit]\label{dfn:audit}
An audit is a document provided to the community to guide them in taking an informed risk.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Community]\label{dfn:community}
A community consists of liquidity providers, investors, swappers, arbitrageurs, governance token holders, and neighboring members or projects of the ecosystem.
\end{definition}

## Desiderata

* **The community is the audience. The community is the customer.** 

* The audit encapsulates **as much as was possible to examine before launch time and is not exhaustive**.

# Considerations

In this chapter, we cover broad concepts and decisions and provide context into the way the development team is thinking about them. This section should add indirect value to the process of taking informed risks.

# Attacks

In this chapter, we profile threat models, attack vectors and vulnerabilities--mostly on the economic- and mechanism-design levels, but occasionally on the software-implementation level as well.
