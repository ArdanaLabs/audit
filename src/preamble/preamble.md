The audit is a preliminary effort to compensate for the fact that proper formal verification before launch is infeasible. 

An audit means many things. Let's be precise about what we mean by audit in this document.

\begin{definition}[Audit]\label{dfn:audit}
An audit is a document provided to the community to guide them in taking informed risk.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Community]\label{dfn:community}
A community consists of liquidity providers, investors, swappers, arbitrageurs, governance token holders, and neighboring members/projects of the ecosystem.
\end{definition}

## Desiderata
* **The community is the audience. The community is the customer.** 

* The audit is **as much as was possible to do before launch time, not exhaustive**.

# Considerations

In this chapter we look at broad concepts and decisions and provide context into the way the team is thinking about them. This section should add indirect value to the process of taking informed risks.

# Attacks

In this chapter we profile threat models, attack vectors, vulnerabilities; mostly on the economic and mechanism design levels, but occasionally on the software implementation level.
